=== ENM IDE Custom Configurations ===

The purpose of this repository is for teams to add scripts and configuration files for further customising their IDE configuration.

The idea is that each team creates a directory for their own scripts and configuration files.

This repository is cloned into $HOME/gitrepos/ide-config during provisioning of the Vagrant guest VM.

### IMPORTANT NOTE ###
Please refrain from adding any binary files or packages since this will significantly impact cloning performance for other users.
The other users are very smart software developers and this will make you look stupid.

Please contact the DE Gitmo team if you require additional tools etc. included.
